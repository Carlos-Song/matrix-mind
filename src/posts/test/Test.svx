## Good stuff in your markdown

Markdown is pretty good but sometimes you just need more.

Sometimes you need a boinger like this:

<Boinger color="{ color }"/>

Not many people have a boinger right in their markdown.

## Markdown in your markdown

Sometimes what you wrote last week is so good that you just *have* to include it again.

I'm not gonna stand in the way of your egomania.

Yeah, thats right you can put wigdets in markdown (`.svx` files or otherwise). You can put markdown in widgets too.

<Seriously>

### I wasn't joking

```
	This is real life
```

</Seriously>

Sometimes you need your widgets **inlined** (like this:<Count count="{number}"/>) because why shouldn't you.
Obviously you have access to values defined in YAML (namespaced under `_metadata`) and anything defined in an fenced `js exec` block can be referenced directly.

Normal markdown stuff works too:

- Like
- This
- List
- Here

And *this* and **THIS**. And other stuff. You can't use `each` blocks. Don't try, it wont work.
